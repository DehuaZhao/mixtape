  - 我们都在自己的路上走着 都是只能回头看但是回不去的旅人 总觉得别人说啊好久没见你变了挺多啊是compliment 要不然这么多年在身上没一点痕迹不是白活了么 但是真的当一个新认识的朋友对着两年前的照片说 一点都不像你诶 感觉照片里的你也就12岁 感觉特别无辜 还是有点难过 但是再想想 感谢时光让我变得坚强

  - __Beauty and the Beast__ from the movie Beauty and the Beast by Ariana Grande & John Legend

- 20170827

  - __I'm Beginning To See the Light__ from Manchester By the Sea (Original Soundtrack Album)
