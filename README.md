## Let's Mix

  - __Beauty and the Beast__ from the movie Beauty and the Beast by Ariana Grande & John Legend
  - My favorite fairy tale hands down. Even though it's overly old and classic, the story is surprisingly short without the songs, and tons of things are super unreasonable, I still, and always, sing with all my heart along with the melody.

  - __I'm Beginning To See the Light__ from Manchester By the Sea (Original Soundtrack Album)
  - My personal favorite 2016 movie. It'a portrait of individual misery, of whom can't help but find shards of hummor wherever he looks.
    > “What happened to your hand?” Patrick asks Lee, noticing bandages and blood. </br>
    > “I cut it.” </br>
    > “Oh, thanks. For a minute there I didn’t know what happened.”

  - __Malibu__ by Miley Cyrus
  - You won't believe it's her, but here she is. What can I say other than LOVE does change people.

- 20170824

  - __苦瓜__ by 陈奕迅
  - Life is all about learning and growing up.
  - Fun fact: My boyfriend recommended this song to me, and apparently he has a really good taste in Cantonese songs.

  - __Jai Ho__ from Slumdog Millionaire (Music from the Motion Picture)
  - My afterwork must-have on the subway
