## Let's Mix

- 20170831

  - __Lovers In Japan (Acoustic Version)__ by Coldplay
  - The lyrics is like poem. The acoustic guitar is smoothing.
  - I got lost with it. I got lost in the neon of Osaka.

- 20170830

  - __M01 謡I - Making of Cyborg__ by 川井憲次 from 攻殻機動隊 O.S.T
  - Hauntingly-beautiful Japanese chant.

- 20170829

  - __时间有泪__
  - My personal preference for the versions: 陈颖恩(中国新歌声2) > 张学友(live) >= 张碧晨(歌手) > 张学友(album)
  - 陈颖恩只缺年纪 张碧晨我觉得有点为了凸显她个人声音的特色唱的很拖沓 歌神的专辑原版做的不好 歌神自己的声音被背景盖过去了 live的就好一些

- 20170829

  - __If the Hudson Overflows__ by Goldspot
  - One of so many great songs about New York City.

- 20170828

  - __Seasons of Love__ from Glee or Rent(musical)
  - How do you measure a year in the life? How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?

- 20170827

  - __F**kin' Perfect__ by P!nk
  - From time to time, I need to listen to this song, cry badly, and then feel much more put together.

- 20170827

  - __All of Me (Live)__ from iTunes Festival: London 2013 by John Legend
  - A live unplugged version.

- 20170826

  - __Beauty and the Beast__ from the movie Beauty and the Beast by Ariana Grande & John Legend
  - My favorite fairy tale hands down. Even though it's overly old and classic, the story is surprisingly short without the songs, and tons of things are super unreasonable, I still, and always, sing with all my heart along with the melody.

- 20170827

  - __I'm Beginning To See the Light__ from Manchester By the Sea (Original Soundtrack Album)
  - My personal favorite 2016 movie. It'a portrait of individual misery, of whom can't help but find shards of hummor wherever he looks.
    > “What happened to your hand?” Patrick asks Lee, noticing bandages and blood. </br>
    > “I cut it.” </br>
    > “Oh, thanks. For a minute there I didn’t know what happened.”

- 20170825

  - __Malibu__ by Miley Cyrus
  - You won't believe it's her, but here she is. What can I say other than LOVE does change people.

- 20170824

  - __苦瓜__ by 陈奕迅
  - Life is all about learning and growing up.
  - Fun fact: My boyfriend recommended this song to me, and apparently he has a really good taste in Cantonese songs.

- 20170825

  - __Jai Ho__ from Slumdog Millionaire (Music from the Motion Picture)
  - My afterwork must-have on the subway
