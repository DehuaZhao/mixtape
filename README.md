  - __Falling Slowly__ from Once
  - A beatiful song from a beautiful movie/musical
  - 想起这首歌和这部电影(还有对应的音乐剧)是今天的中国新歌声 小川小虎唱的version超美但是得票率7/51 开播这么久头一次关注得票率就这样...

  - __Lovers In Japan (Acoustic Version)__ by Coldplay

  - __时间有泪__
  - My personal preference for the versions: 陈颖恩(中国新歌声2) > 张学友(live) >= 张碧晨(歌手) > 张学友(album)
  - 陈颖恩只缺年纪 张碧晨我觉得有点为了凸显她个人声音的特色唱的很拖沓 歌神的专辑原版做的不好 歌神自己的声音被背景盖过去了 live的就好一些

- 20170826

  - __Beauty and the Beast__ from the movie Beauty and the Beast by Ariana Grande & John Legend
  - My favorite fairy tale hands down. Even though it's overly old and classic, the story is surprisingly short without the songs, and tons of things are super unreasonable, I still, and always, sing with all my heart along with the melody.

- 20170827

  - __I'm Beginning To See the Light__ from Manchester By the Sea (Original Soundtrack Album)
  - My personal favorite 2016 movie. It'a portrait of individual misery, of whom can't help but find shards of hummor wherever he looks.
    > “What happened to your hand?” Patrick asks Lee, noticing bandages and blood.<br>

    > “Oh, thanks. For a minute there I didn’t know what happened.”
